/*Given a set of n integers, divide the set in two subsets of n/2 sizes each such that the difference
 of the sum of two subsets is as minimum as possible. If n is even, then sizes of two subsets must be strictly n/2 and if n is odd, 
 then size of one subset must be (n-1)/2 and size of other subset must be (n+1)/2
 
 For example, let given set be {3, 4, 5, -3, 100, 1, 89, 54, 23, 20}, the size of set is 10. Output for 
 this set should be {4, 100, 1, 23, 20} and {3, 5, -3, 89, 54}. Both output subsets are of size 5 and sum of elements in
  both subsets is same (148 and 148). Let us consider another example where n is odd. 
  Let given set be {23, 45, -34, 12, 0, 98, -99, 4, 189, -1, 4}. The output subsets should be {45, -34, 12, 98, -1} and {23, 0, -99, 4, 189, 4}. 
  The sums of elements in two subsets are 120 and 121 respectively.
